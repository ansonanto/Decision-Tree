# Decision-Tree
Decision Tree implementation as part of ML course
A dataset collected in a cosmetics shop showing details of customers and whether or not they responded to a special offer to buy a new lip-stick is shown in table below. Use this dataset to build a decision tree, with Buys as the target variable, to help in buying lip-sticks in the future. Find the root node of decision tree. According to the decision tree you have made from previous training data set, what is the decision for the test data: [Age < 21, Income = Low, Gender = Female, Marital Status = Married]?
